# Chapter One: Computer Networks and the Internet


## What is the internet

### Vocab
- Hosts
- End systems
- Communication packets
- Packet switches
- Transmission Rate
- Packets
- Routers
- Link-Layer Switches
- Route, Path
- Internet Service Provider (ISPs)
- Protocols
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Internet Protocol (IP)
- request for comments (RFCs)
- Internet standards
- distributed applications

### Questions
1. What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several different types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?

They are the same thing. 

2. Who's controlling the internet? Is the internet damaging the environment? Can anyone shut it down?

3. What is a sneaker net? Explain the main characteristics of networking. Mention the key design issues of a computer network?
